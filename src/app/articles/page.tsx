     <h3 className="mb-8">By Craig L. Claybrook, Reciter of the Declaration</h3>
     <p className="mb-8 leading-7">For decades and decades, Americans enthusiastically read <em>The Declaration of Independence</em> in the public
      arena, in schools, and on Fourth of July. But now, we celebrate our independence but not the document
      that gave us our independence—and it seems to have disappeared into oblivion. So, what can be done
      to launch the Declaration back onto the national stage?” And, “why is this so important?”</p>
     <p className="mb-8 leading-7">Consider this reasoning: 1. the significance and impact of the document, 2. the “Foundational
      Underpinnings” of the document, 3. the deliberate demise of the document’s “worth,” and 4. the
      overwhelming need for a triumphal return of the document.</p>
     <p className="mb-8 leading-7"><strong>First, the significance and impact of the document.</strong>Church historians tell us that the Declaration is “one
      of the two most significant documents in human history, second only to the Bible.” The reason for this is
      that, not only was it instrumental in ending the tyranny of the king of England, but it was also
      instrumental in terminating a whopping 2000 years of tyranny in Western Civilization. The magnitude of
      this achievement is staggering! It obliterated 2000 years of tyranny, dating back to the beginning of the
      Roman Empire and before the time of Christ! The only feat surpassing the Declaration would be Christ’s
      redemptive death on the Cross and His offer of forgiveness of sin to mankind!</p>
     <p className="mb-8 leading-7">The other document happens to be The Constitution of the United States. It took 116 days for the
      Founding Fathers to draft the Constitution in 1787 but the countries that were set free by the
      Declaration were still foundering in a governance quandary. In an act of magnanimity, the Founders sent
      copies of the document to all of those countries. They thought the Constitution was magnificent so, they
      all became “Constitutional Republics,” as did all fifty of our state governments! Scholars tell us that
      these two documents stand out as “the pinnacle of Western Civilization since the time of Christ!” Today,
      the Constitution is under merciless attack by secularists who defy our glorious and God-given
      beginnings.</p>
     <p className="mb-8 leading-7"><strong>Second, the “Foundational Underpinnings” of the document.</strong>Secular historians tell us that the pathway
      to <em>The Declaration of Independence</em> began when the British attacked Lexington, Massachusetts “at dawn
      on April 19, 1775.” But church historians inform us that the pathway started 700 years prior to that!
      They also let us know that three pivotal events profoundly shaped America’s Foundational
      Underpinnings: 1. In 1075, Pope Gregory VII admonished the kings and rulers of Western Europe to stay
      out of the church’s business. 2. In 1215, Cardinal Stephen Langton introduced his spectacular document,
      the <em>Magna Carta</em> to “reign in” political tyrants. 3. In 1517, Luther tacked his ninety-five theses onto the
      Wittenburg door, then inadvertently created two reformations, one religious and one political. Both
      continue to this day. Politically, he became known for his Resistance Theory: to disobey unjust rulers
      and their laws.”</p>
     <p className="mb-8 leading-7">Why were these events so vitally important? Pope Gregory VII started the march to America’s freedom
      with what became known as “freedom of religion.” It also set forth the original meaning of “separation
      of church and state.” Cardinal Stephen Langton’s 3500-word <em>Magna Carta</em> was designated as Britain’s
      foremost legal document and it still holds that distinction. It dealt with the foremost legal issue of the
      Middle Ages, “limiting the power of kings.” Martin Luther’s theses caused the pope to put him on trial
      for heresy. When he argued that “it was wrong for anyone to act against his conscience in religious
      matters,” he set off a firestorm that became known as “liberty of conscience.” These three “episodes” in
      our Foundational Underpinnings paved the way for the Declaration.</p>
     <p className="mb-8 leading-7"><strong>Third, the deliberate demise of the document’s “worth.”</strong>The demise of the Declaration started out,
      oddly enough, in a court of law. The 1947 U.S. Supreme Court was considering a case known as <em>Everson
       v. Board of Education</em>, which had to do with taxpayer dollars being used to transport children to
      parochial schools. An amicus brief from an atheistic organization introduced the Court to “wall of
      separation of church and state” with a twist. Pope Gregory VII’s original “separation” in 1075 was meant
      “to keep the state out of the church’s business” but this had never been codified into law. In order to
      “secularize America,” the Court then revamped it to mean the exact opposite of its original meaning. (All
      of this took place during an era when roughly seventy percent of the population attended church.)</p>
     <p className="mb-8 leading-7">This unprincipled decision lay dormant until the 1963 Supreme Court dredged it up when considering
      <em>Murray v. Curlett</em>, a case filed by atheist Madalyn Murray O’Hair to ban Bible reading in public schools.
      Prayer had already been banned in 1962 but this case became the spectacle that launched America’s
      “secularization/de-Christianization” onto the national stage. This resulted in an onslaught of court cases
      in the ’60s and beyond. What were the results? In short, a multitude of younger folk took the plunge
      into illegal drugs and “free love.” The decade ended with a tribute to this “de-Christianization” called
      Woodstock and, by decade’s end, America’s educational system had gone from being “the envy of the
      world” to utter chaos: “plummeting classroom discipline” and “skyrocketing teen pregnancies.”</p>
     <p className="mb-8 leading-7">How does the Declaration fit into this? Quite simply, the Declaration contains four references to God.
      These four references are found in the first two sentences and last two sentences, effectively forming
      bookends around the Declaration. This was the Founders’ way of “shouting from the rooftops” that God
      is “in” the Declaration and “in” the founding of this country! But in recent years, secularists took it upon
      themselves to deliver the “crowning blow” to <em>The Declaration of Independence</em> and America’s
      Foundational Underpinnings by eliminating History from the curriculum of most public schools—the
      ultimate “demise!” Another noteworthy detail is that the Chief Justice who ramrodded “separation” in
      1947 was awarded as “The Most Influential Supreme Court Justice of the Twentieth Century!”</p>
     <p className="mb-8 leading-7"><strong>Fourth, the overwhelming need for a triumphal return of the document.</strong>These four references to God
      provide the key element to “launching the Declaration onto the national stage.” They stand in sharp
      contrast to the Court’s 1947 definition of “separation of church and state.” But how many people today
      even know about this contradiction? ... or about Pope Gregory VII’s original “separation of church and
      state?” ... or about those three pivotal events? ... or about America’s Foundational Underpinnings?
      Or the fact that these four references are “the most consequential components of the Declaration!”</p>
     <p className="mb-8 leading-7">As for the “demise of worth,” a plethora of people and organizations would favor restoring its worth if
      presented with the need!” We are an army lacking vision so, focus on: 1. grasping the magnitude of “the
      two most significant documents in human history, second only to the Bible,” and “the pinnacle of
      Western Civilization since the time of Christ,” 2. recognizing that the hand of God is still “on” the
      Declaration, 3. comprehending that, without these four references to God, the Declaration would have
      been “an empty shell of a document,” and 4. joining forces with others. All of these things are key!</p>
     <p className="mb-8 leading-7">These four references to God serve as a catalyst for “launching the Declaration onto the national stage.”
      They also serve as a catalyst for spiritual awakening.” They go “hand in hand.” And, if you are so
      inclined, please pass the “snippet” of the Declaration along to three or more friends via the Internet.
      Thank you for your help in “launching” the Declaration with your prayers, concern, and effort!</p>
